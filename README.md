Long Range Genomic Contacts
===========================

An effort to visualize long range genomic interactions with d3.

### Drosophila Melanogaster - Long Range Chromatin Interaction

Using Hi-C data from Sexton et al 2012, I created an interaction map between physical domains and epigentic classes, per chromosome.
The blocks denote domains, delimited by color and the gray arcs indicate interactions.
